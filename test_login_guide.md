## ðŸ§ª **How to Test Login:**

### 1. **First Time Setup:**
- Open the app
- You should see the login screen with a green gradient background
- Click "Don't have an account? Register"
- Fill in all fields:
  - Full Name: `Test User`
  - Address: `Test Address`
  - User Type: Select either `farmer` or `retailer`
  - Email: `test@example.com`
  - Password: `password123` (at least 6 characters)
- Click "Register"
- You should see "Registration successful! Please login."

### 2. **Login Test:**
- Use the same email and password from registration
- Click "Login"
- You should be redirected to the appropriate home screen based on user type

### 3. **Troubleshooting:**

**If login still fails:**

1. **Check Console Output:**
   - Look for debug messages like:
     - "Initializing Firebase..."
     - "Firebase initialized successfully"
     - "Attempting login for email: ..."
     - "Login successful for user: ..."

2. **Common Issues:**
   - **Firebase Connection**: Make sure you have internet connection
   - **Firebase Project**: Verify the Firebase project is properly configured
   - **Authentication Rules**: Check if Firebase Auth rules allow email/password

3. **Debug Steps:**
   - Try registering a new account first
   - Check if the user document is created in Firestore
   - Verify the auth state listener is working

## ðŸ”§ **Remaining Minor Issues:**

The app now has 228 minor style warnings (down from 238) that don't affect functionality:
- Missing `const` keywords for performance
- Missing `key` parameters for widgets
- Some deprecated method usage

These are cosmetic and won't prevent login from working.

## ðŸ“± **Expected Behavior:**

- **Registration**: Creates user in Firebase Auth + Firestore
- **Login**: Authenticates user and loads profile data
- **Navigation**: Redirects to farmer/retailer home based on user type
- **Logout**: Returns to login screen

## ðŸš¨ **If Still Having Issues:**

1. Check the debug console for error messages
2. Verify Firebase project configuration
3. Ensure internet connectivity
4. Try clearing app data and restarting

The login functionality should now work properly with the fixes applied!
